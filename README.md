Turn on LED lights when an object moves close to the ultrasonic sensor, then turn the lights off again after a set timeout period.

### Parts
* Arduino uno
* Vairety of wires and resistors
* Ultrasonic sensor
* 5V/2A wall plug
* Led 5050 strip lights

### Future Improvements
* Use remote in arduino kit to control lights
* Turn lights on gradually rather than immediately
* Connect to google home
* 7 segment display to show current time/lights turning on
* Send email/text to show weekly statistics, power usage
